# Rock, paper, scissors with Frank

A small app to play rock-paper-scissors and a fun way to implement some ideas that I had.

It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It only uses **JSX** and **CSS-in-JS** with Nextjs's `<style jsx>`.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
